# health-admin
The Health Admin Interface Project lets you work with the Health Data References/ Aggregation/ Storage Projects as an easy to use no-code web application.

The main goal is to be a first minimalistic one-stop-shop to use our core projects, but also as a starting point to build your own health application.
